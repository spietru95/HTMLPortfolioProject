  <h3>What am I about?</h3>
   <p>Hi!  My name is Steven Pietrusza.  I am 21 years old.  I was born in San Diego, California, but I currently live in Jacksonville, Florida.  I'm a recent graduate taking some time off before I apply to medical school.  I've been pretty busy.  I'm trying to learn as much and do as much and see as much and make as much as possible.  I play piano, guitar, I'm learning to code(though this website makes that obvious doesn't it.), I'm working as a Monitor Tech, I'm doing anti-cancer drug synthesis research, I'm volunteering with a hospice <em>and</em> an online crisis text platform, I'm training to run a 5k...<br>
     Sorry if I seem a little manic.  Let me rewind a little bit.  Last year, I applied to medical school and was rejected from every school to which I applied.  That experience, for a number of reasons, humbled, inspired, straightened, and clarified me.  To put it simply, getting my ass kicked in medical school admissions did me right.  I've been in an extremely positive mind set so I'm taking more voluntary time off from medical school to keep up this momentum I've built.  I'm learning, I'm doing, and goddamn it feels good!</p>
